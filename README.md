# webpack-tutorial
Following two Webpack tutorials by Valentino Gagliardi:

[The first one](https://www.valentinog.com/blog/babel/) is in the folder called `valentino`

[The second one](https://www.valentinog.com/blog/webpack/) is in the folder called -- wait for it! -- `valentino2`

Verdict: Good tutorials.  Nice and clear.  Despite the order in which I approached them I think `valentino` is an evolution of `valentino2`.  `valentino2` is a bit more thorough, showing how to get Webpack working with css and Vue and not just React, Babel, and HTML.
